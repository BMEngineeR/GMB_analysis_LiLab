# TCGA Cell Analysis Project

This repository contains data and scripts related to the analysis of cell expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our focus is on understanding the signaling pathways and cell development processes through various computational biology techniques.

## Directory Structure

- **ANGIOGENESIS.v2022.1.Hs.grp**: Group file containing identifiers for genes involved in angiogenesis.
- **BROWN_MYELOID_CELL_DEVELOPMENT_U...**: Gene set for studying myeloid cell development.
- **Figure1F.R**: R script for generating Figure 1F.
- **Figure1G.Rmd**: R Markdown script for generating Figure 1G.
- **GSE9650_EXHAUSTED_VS_MEMORY_CD8...**: Data file for exhausted vs. memory CD8 T-cell analysis.
- **KEGG_T_CELL_RECEPTOR_SIGNALING_PA...**: Gene set from KEGG for T-cell receptor signaling pathways.
- **ReadME**: Basic information file.
- **TCGA_cell_2013_exp.Rdata**: R data file containing expression data for TCGA 2013 dataset.
- **TCGA_cell_2013_meta.Rdata**: R data file containing metadata for TCGA 2013 dataset.

## Usage

To reproduce the figures and results in this repository, run the R scripts (`Figure1F.R` and `Figure1G.Rmd`). Ensure you have R and the necessary packages installed.

### Prerequisites

- R (version 4.0 or later)
- RStudio (Recommended for ease of use with RMarkdown files)

### Running the Scripts

1. Open `Figure1F.R` in RStudio and run the script to generate Figure 1F.
2. Open `Figure1G.Rmd` in RStudio, knit the document to generate Figure 1G along with the narrative.
